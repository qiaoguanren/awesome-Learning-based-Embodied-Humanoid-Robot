# awesome-Learning-based-Embodied-Humanoid-Robot [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

Humanoid robots have significant potential to master a wide range of tasks under human workspaces, making them essential embodiments of artificial intelligence in real-world environments. In the recent development of control algorithms for humanoid robots, considerable attention has been given to learning-based methods, primarily due to their superior flexibility and generalizability compared to traditional model-based control approaches. 

To help more people stay informed about the latest progress in humanoid robots, I have systematically collected and classified papers on locomotion, manipulation, loco-manipulation, and human-robot interaction tasks; learning-based approaches (e.g., RL, IL, VLA); and related surveys, simulators, and benchmarks.
